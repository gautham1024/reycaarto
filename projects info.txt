Triangulation of Aerial and Satellite:
 <p>We are herewith describing the Triangulation (aerial/satellite) projects which have been executed recently. We have successfully completed many triangulation projects of different scales (1:500, 1:1000, 1:2000, 1:5000, 1:10000) from various sensors like Aerial Frame & Digital, ADS40 and Satellite sensors. We have produced multi-scale maps for various purposes and with content from different countries and communities. These sample triangulation project shows our (<strong>AAMGST</strong>) capabilities in Triangulation. Please find the details of sample projects as mentioned below.<br>
<br>

<strong>AAMGST</strong> has qualified and experienced staff to carry out triangulation. Fast and accurate solution provider in digital aerial triangulation and with latest technology and in automated methods. <strong>AAMGST</strong> provides the best technology services and solutions to geospatial industry. Our staff experts in GNSS/IMU and Latest sensors (Airborne Digital Sensors like ADS 40) supported triangulation. Also having the capacity to handle huge blocks.<br>
<br>

<strong>AAMGST</strong> utilizes a highly automated aero triangulation approach that minimizes operator intervention and promotes high quality. <strong>AAMGST</strong>â€™s methodology combines point selection, point measurement, point transfer and efficient block adjustment in a single process. <strong>AAMGST</strong> can take on any job, irrespective of size and complexity. Our staffs are expertise in doing aerial triangulation of Corridor mapping, Vegetation areas and Snow areas.<br>

Project description :</strong> This project includes three scales for same area and which involves triangulation detailed mapping and orthophoto generation. Firstly triangulation of three sets of imagery and then DTM compilation for 1:5000 scale mapping and Detailed mapping from 1:2000 scales.  The images of three scale of photography have been triangulated by using our software, ground controls and GPS/INS.
Automatic tie point extraction method has been used after measuring the ground control points and with the help of GPS/INS. Our AT experts were successful in achieving the excellent results by efficient block adjustments in all three scales. The final results were submitted in different formats like Inpho, PATB, ZI, BINGO and ASCII exterior orientation parameters.

  Project description :</strong> Triangulation of all images have been completed in single block using GPS/IMU and Ground control points. The quality of AT has been verified by the residuals of ground controls and tie points. Finally the block has been adjusted efficiently and  AT reports has been sent to client. The final results were imported in to stereo work station and ground control points have verified in stereo then  report also been sent to client. The results of triangulation have been submitted in different formats like Inpho, PATB, ZI and Bingo. Graphical reports like point connections (tie, ground control) and error ellipse were submitted.<br><br>

The purpose of the project is to restitute the obstacles around the airport area. This has been ahieved by restituting the building block, towers, mosque and other constructions. Restitution of building blocks with elevation (height) points and Delimitation of roads, streets, wooded area, Agriculture, pasture, bare soil and Rivers, lakes in urban and rural areas. </p>
